# ♠️ Week08 Bootcamp2019a Project: Matching Card Game

I made a 12 card matching game because, 12 is lucky :)
All jokes aside, 12 was more fun and looked better than 10.
The cards are all from Magic the Gathering. The only thing I
would change about the project would maybe creating a gallery of
background images and cycling on different days of the week. All of the 
background images would be pictures of game tables, just to add to theme.
